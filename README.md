#Mindful Matter - a calming voice interface to help you relax

For my final hello computers project taken by Nicole He, I decided to work on a conversation UI based interaction using voice. I wanted the website to be calm and relaxing with the colors in the background setting moods for different questions. Users are guided through the website and they have to answer some questions and click few buttons to enable microphone access. 
The web app enables users to take a break from something that makes them anxious, stressed or upset and gives them a break from continuing on with the things that are bothering them.
